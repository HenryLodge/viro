Project Name: Viro
What Viro does
During an outbreak, the hardest problem isn’t just treating patients—it’s getting the right patients to the right care fast while hospitals and doctors are overwhelmed. SURGE is an AI-powered triage + routing system that collects structured patient intake data (symptoms, severity flags, risk factors, and recent travel/exposure history), estimates urgency tiers (critical / urgent / routine / self-care guidance), and then matches patients to nearby hospitals/clinics based on real-time capacity and doctor availability. For clinicians and public health teams, SURGE also monitors incoming symptom patterns across regions to detect unusual shifts (a possible sign of a changing outbreak, reporting artifacts, or variant-like behavior) and recommends containment actions like targeted messaging, pop-up clinics, and staffing reallocation.

Layer 1 — Patient Intake & Triage (highest priority)
This is your centerpiece. Build a web form or simple app where a user inputs symptoms, severity, risk factors, and exposure history. On the backend, an AI model processes that input and returns an urgency tier (critical / urgent / routine / self-care) with an explanation of why.
Implementation: You don't need to train a custom model. Use an LLM (like Claude's API) with a well-crafted system prompt that acts as a triage engine. Feed it structured patient data and have it return a JSON response with the tier, reasoning, and key risk flags. This is fast to build and genuinely impressive in demo. Alternatively, if you want something more "traditional ML," a decision-tree or rule-based classifier works fine for a hackathon — you can define triage logic based on established clinical guidelines (like the Emergency Severity Index).
Layer 2 — Smart Routing (medium priority)
Once a patient has a triage tier, match them to a facility. For the hackathon, you don't need real hospital APIs. Create a mock dataset of 10–20 hospitals/clinics with attributes like current capacity, specialties available, distance from patient, and wait time. Then build a simple matching algorithm: filter by what the patient needs, rank by availability and proximity, return the top recommendation with a map view.
Implementation: A lightweight scoring function works fine. Something like: weighted score = (capacity weight × available beds) + (distance weight × 1/distance) + (specialty match bonus). Display results on a map using something like Leaflet.js or Google Maps embed.


Layer 3 — Global Epidemiological Network Globe
The Vision:
A rotating 3D globe where nodes are placed at geographic coordinates representing cities, hospitals, or monitoring regions. Nodes pulse and change size/color based on real-time symptom severity or case volume. Edges between nodes represent connections — patient transfers, outbreak spread paths, or resource sharing links. When an anomaly is detected in a region, that node flares up and the connecting edges highlight to show potential cascade paths.
